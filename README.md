# userbase-maker
Customizable script that generates userbases randomly that can be directly copied and used in .sim files of CloudAnalyst software. 
The script provides a .txt file that contains the directly usable format that can be copied into a .sim file. 
Note: Do not use the UB1 and UB2 that is generated, .sim files use a slightly different format for the first 2 userbases.
